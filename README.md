Project Description:
	This final project is a reaction based game. The player fights against the computer enemy and must react to the attack that is prompted at the top of the screen. The player can dodge in three different directions and attack from one. This is done by utilizing the joystick to flick in the direction you want the character to act in. If the player gets a perfect dodge (dodging just before getting hit), the player can attack right away to gain an advantage. When the enemy health reaches zero the game starts again with the enemy back at full health but the health of the player remaining the same. This continues until the player’s health reaches zero and then the high score (round number) is saved.

User Guide:
Rules:
	The objective is to kill the enemy and get to the highest round possible. Other than that there are no rules.

Controls:
	Hold up or down on the start screen to play or look at the current high score. Once in the game the player can flick right on the joystick to attack. While the monster is charging at the player its attack will be telegraphed up top based on the arrows. You must dodge in a direction that the arrow(s) are not pointing in. This is done by simply flicking the joystick in your desired direction. Dodging in the wrong way causes double damage to be taken. If the player dodges at just the right time, they can counterattack by flicking the joystick right for a free hit.





	Special Considerations: 
	The sound is pretty annoying. This can be fixed by unplugging any wire from the small black cylinder.
